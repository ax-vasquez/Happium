/**
 * Entity representation of AppiumSession
 *
 * <p>
 *     On each new payload receipt (and after the payload has
 *     been validated), a new AppiumSession is created and its
 *     details are stored in a local database.
 * <p>
 *     Extend this class to customize the metrics you wish to
 *     track in your database instance(s).
 * <p>
 *     This class should be seen as the data representation of
 *     a given AppiumSession - it is NOT the only code that
 *     serves to support an Appium Session. The full supporting
 *     code is like so:
 *
 *     (lowest layer) Entity > Repository > Service > Application (highest layer)
 *
 *     Entity is the data layer, Repository is the DAO (data access object),
 *     Service is the "business logic" layer and the Application is the
 *     controlling class (e.g. Application.class). This is
 *     a standard division of labor in a Spring application.
