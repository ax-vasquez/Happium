This is BRAND NEW - no documentation for this yet, but all you need to know for now is that this is THE CENTRAL ELEMENT TO HAPPIUM. You 
should configure as many instances as you need. Each `happium-node-service` can be configured to be either a `Hub` or a `Node` that 
registers to a `Hub`. I still need to add a convenient way to configure instances on-the-fly (both the internal Jetty servlet engine and 
the Happium-specific Tomcat engine).
